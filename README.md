# Roll-to-Victory-game

"Roll to Victory" is a fun and simple dice game where players race to reach a target score before anyone else. Each player takes turns rolling a die to add points to their total. But be careful! If you roll a **1**, you lose all the points you earned in that turn, and your turn ends immediately.  

The game is all about luck and strategy. Do you keep rolling to build a big lead, or do you play it safe and hold onto your points? The first player to reach **50 points** (or any chosen target) wins!  

Itâ€™s a game of risks, rewards, and plenty of surprises. So, grab some friends, roll the dice, and see who will claim victory! ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¥
